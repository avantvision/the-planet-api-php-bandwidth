Installation:

Download, decompress, upload to a php enabled server, upload everything to a new folder just to make sure...

Edit config.php

put your orbit api username, password, hardware id ( if you don't know it don't worry) and your ip address...

if you don't know your hardware id, write your ip adress in config.php and visit hwtype.php there you should see a 5 digit code, that's your hardware id, go back to config.php and write that digit where it's supposed to.

That's it..!!

Visit now index.php and see your bandwidth graphics..!!!


Thanks to the planet staff and the guys at php freenode irc channel.

I encourage you to work upon this and make it better.
